## Overview ##

BirdEye is a community project to advance the design and development of a comprehensive open source information visualization and visual analytics library for Adobe Flex.  The actionscript-based library enables users to create multi-dimensional data visualization interfaces for the analysis and presentation of information.
The project is based on development and the integration/adoption of related open source libraries (see credits and attributions).  For status of development, refer to the wiki pages.
